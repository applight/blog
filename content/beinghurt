For the last few days (8/16/2022) I've been suffering serious abdomin pain.
It has no ryme or reason. Anything I eat, injest, etc... everything has upset it, minus my gf and a laxitive. I'm going to the hospital today because it's unbearable.

Worst torture of my life, right in front of my girlfriend and my friend Patrick. Seems deliberate.
