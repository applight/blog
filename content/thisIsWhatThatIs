My name is Matthew Vaughan. I'm a drug addict. I'm also human being.

Since I was 23 years old, people have engaged in a campaign of gaslighting, descrimination, and abuse toward me.

The people who engage in these activities do so for a variety of reasons. Most tell themselves that they are doing so for my benefit... that somehow they are going to abuse me sober.

What actually occurs is different.

The reason I do drugs in the first place is to escape my depression, to elliminate pain in my life. By dividing me from society, people have garenteed that I'll have more of it.

I wanted to do other things with my life:
I'm a computer scientist, an engineer, an entrepreuner...

I was denied jobs, I was embarrased, abused, and tortured.
The love of my life was tortured into abusing me.

I wanted something beautiful and simple in my life. I was in love (and I still am) with a girl who made me happier than anything in life was ever able.
