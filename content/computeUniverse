Some physics stuff

1) For an 11-Matrix you insert the state of each 11 dimensional plank space time, such that the 11-Matrix contains the state of the Universe.
2) Imagine you wish to compute the universe moving forward in time
---> It turns out this in uneccisary and vacuous!
---> A thought experiment:
If you start from the big bang, then moving away any one plank space time (in space or time... same thing in this Matrix) and compute the state for that cell...
you compute the universe
